# Advance Shortest Path
 . implement Bidirectional Dijkstra and use it to compute distances in social networks very quickly; 2. implement A* search algorithm and apply it to compute distances in road networks faster than the classic algorithms do; 3. implement Contraction Hierarchies algorithm and apply it to preprocess large road networks and then compute distances in them much faster;
