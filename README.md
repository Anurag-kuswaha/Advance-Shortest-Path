 ## 1. implemented Bidirectional Dijkstra and use it to compute distances in social networks very quickly;
 ## 2. implemented A* search algorithm and apply it to compute distances in road networks faster than the classic algorithms do.
 ## 3. implemented Contraction Hierarchies algorithm and apply it to preprocess large road networks and then compute distances in them much faster;
