                                    # Advance Shortest Path
 ## 1. implemented Bidirectional Dijkstra and use it to compute distances in social networks very quickly;
 
 ## 2. implemented A* search algorithm and apply it to compute distances in road networks faster than the classic algorithms do.
        1- Implemented the Single Direction A* alogirthm with pre-computed potential function     ( ## Faster than all)  
        2- Implemented the Bidirectional A* alogirthm                                             ( ## slower than 1st)
        3- Implemented the Single Direction A* alogirthm;                                         ( ## slower than 2nd) 
        
       
 ## 3. implemented Contraction Hierarchies algorithm and apply it to preprocess large road networks and then compute distances in them much faster;
