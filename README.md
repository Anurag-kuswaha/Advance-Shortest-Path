                                    # Advance Shortest Path
 ## 1. implemented Bidirectional Dijkstra and use it to compute distances in social networks very quickly;
 
 ## 2. implemented A* search algorithm and apply it to compute distances in road networks faster than the classic algorithms do.
        1- Implemented the Single Direction A* alogirthm;
        2- Implemented the Single Direction A* alogirthm with pre-computed potential function
        3- Implemented the Bidirectional A* alogirthm 
 ## 3. implemented Contraction Hierarchies algorithm and apply it to preprocess large road networks and then compute distances in them much faster;
